## Background

While COVID was still making headlines everyday, I decided to make an app. An artist I really like spoke in an interview about how he used voice memos to remember ideas during the day. This made me think about how the default voice memos app doesn't support multi-track functionality or sharing tracks. I felt that this app could help creatives express themselves and make collaboration easier.

### Conclusion

I really did love working on Voicebox. For a time it was my baby. It was a large commitment and overall an ambitious project that I am proud to have worked on. The project was an overall success and the initial requirements for a beta were fulfilled. I plan to monitor and update the app in the coming time. Maybe an iOS version could be next, but for now I'm resting ðŸ˜´ - Sachin (7/22/2021)
